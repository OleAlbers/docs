The [Pulumi Console](https://app.pulumi.com) supports System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) 2.0 integration with different identity providers. This support requires Pulumi Enterprise Edition. To learn more about the capabilities of the Enterprise Edition, see the [pricing page]({{< relref "/pricing" >}}).

To leverage SCIM between Pulumi and your SAML 2.0 identity provider, refer to one of our example guides:
