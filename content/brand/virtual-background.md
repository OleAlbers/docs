         Life is hard and sometimes we just have to let everyone know that it is time to relax and take a load off. Whether you've had an intense week of work or your child has been asking you for 72 hours straight when the pandemic will be over, this background let's everyone know you're ready hit the beach and not have a care in the world.

        Everyone has those days where they just wake up ready to attack the world and do as much good as they possibly. If you wake up in the morning ready to "shred the gnar" that is life, then this background is for you. Let all your co-workers know that today is that day you are finally going to finish that thing you've been saying your going to finish for the last 6 months.

        Regardless of where you fall on love/hate spectrum of robots we can all agree of one thing, they require maintenance. And this background represents that exactly. Use this as your background on the days your doing those important maintenance tasks no one ever thanks you for, but prevents your organization from collapsing entirely.
